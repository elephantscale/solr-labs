# Solr install

In this lab we will practice the installation of the Solr server.


Lab Goals:

* Install Solr and verify its operation
* Prepare to use this install for all subsequent labs

### STEP 1) Login to the server
 
Each student is provided his/her individual server and credentials

(Instructor: use m3.medium instance and Solr security group)

### STEP 2) Verify the environment

Verify that you have Java installed 
```bash
    java -version
```
### STEP 3) Download and install Solr

Solr is found here, [Solr web site]

```bash
https://www-eu.apache.org/dist/lucene/solr/7.6.0
```

Find out the link to download, copy the link, then use the wget (or curl) command to place the Solr bundle on your server, such as


```bash
    wget https://www-eu.apache.org/dist/lucene/solr/7.6.0/solr-7.6.0.tgz
```

Decompress and untar the bundle. Put solr in your home directory, like this:

```bash
    tar zxf solr-7.6.0.tgz
    mv solr-7.6.0 ~/solr
```
### STEP 4) Start Solr

Assuming that `$SOLR_INSTALL/` is where you put your Solr

```bash
    export SOLR_INSTALL=/home/ubuntu/solr
    cd $SOLR_INSTALL
    ./bin/solr start -e cloud
```    

You will see the following output:

```console

Welcome to the SolrCloud example!

This interactive session will help you launch a SolrCloud cluster on your local workstation.
To begin, how many Solr nodes would you like to run in your local cluster? (specify 1-4 nodes) [2]:
```

**Select the Defaults value of 2 for number of nodees.**

```console
Ok, let's start up 2 Solr nodes for your example SolrCloud cluster.
Please enter the port for node1 [8983]:

Please enter the port for node2 [7574]:
```

**Select the Defaults value of `8983` and `7574` respectively for node1 and node2 port.**

You will observe the following output:

```console
Starting up Solr on port 8983 using command:
"bin/solr" start -cloud -p 8983 -s "example/cloud/node1/solr"

Waiting up to 180 seconds to see Solr running on port 8983 [\]
Started Solr server on port 8983 (pid=34942). Happy searching!

Starting up Solr on port 7574 using command:
"bin/solr" start -cloud -p 7574 -s "example/cloud/node2/solr" -z localhost:9983

Waiting up to 180 seconds to see Solr running on port 7574 [\]
Started Solr server on port 7574 (pid=35036). Happy searching!


INFO  - 2017-07-27 12:28:02.835; org.apache.solr.client.solrj.impl.ZkClientClusterStateProvider; Cluster at localhost:9983 ready
```

You will now be asked to create a collection. Note that we will **NOT** be selecting the default collection in this case:

```console
Now let's create a new collection for indexing documents in your 2-node cluster.
Please provide a name for your new collection: 
```

Type in the name `techproducts` at the prompt at hit enter. It will now as you how many shards you want. The default 
value of `2` is fine.

```console
How many shards would you like to split techproducts into? [2]
```

It will now as you how many replicas per shard you want. In this case the default of 2 is also fine.

```console
How many replicas per shard would you like to create? [2]
```

It will now ask you about the configsets. In this case you will **NOT** be selecting the default.


```console
Please choose a configuration for the techproducts collection, available options are:
_default or sample_techproducts_configs 
```

You will type in `sample_techproducts_configs` and hit enter.

You should see the following output:
```console
Created collection 'techproducts' with 2 shard(s), 2 replica(s) with config-set 'techproducts'

Enabling auto soft-commits with maxTime 3 secs using the Config API

POSTing request to Config API: http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/config

Successfully set-property updateHandler.autoSoftCommit.maxTime to 3000


SolrCloud example running, please visit: http://localhost:8983/solr
```


### STEP 5) Verify If Solr Is Up And Running

Open this URL in your browser: 

```bash
http://your-server-url:8983/solr
```

You will be redirected to the Solr admin console


### STEP 7) Index some data

```bash
    bin/post -c techproducts example/exampledocs/*
```

You should see the following output:
```console
java -classpath /home/ubuntu/solr/dist/solr-core-7.6.0.jar -Dauto=yes -Dc=techproducts -Ddata=files org.apache.solr.util.SimplePostTool example/exampledocs/books.csv example/exampledocs/books.json example/exampledocs/gb18030-example.xml example/exampledocs/hd.xml example/exampledocs/ipod_other.xml example/exampledocs/ipod_video.xml example/exampledocs/manufacturers.xml example/exampledocs/mem.xml example/exampledocs/money.xml example/exampledocs/monitor2.xml example/exampledocs/monitor.xml example/exampledocs/more_books.jsonl example/exampledocs/mp500.xml example/exampledocs/post.jar example/exampledocs/sample.html example/exampledocs/sd500.xml example/exampledocs/solr-word.pdf example/exampledocs/solr.xml example/exampledocs/test_utf8.sh example/exampledocs/utf8-example.xml example/exampledocs/vidcard.xml

```

### STEP 8) Answer the following questions:

1 What is the value of the lucene-spec version property for your Solr server?

2 What is the log level of the org.apache.solr.core.SolrConfig class?

3 What is the value of the maxDoc property for the cores present?

4 What is the value of the java.vm.vendor Java system property?

5 What is the segment count for the cores present?

6 What is the response time of pinging your server?

7 What is the top term for the manu field? (Hint: select the manu field in the schema
browser, and click the Load Term Info button.)

8 What is the current size of your documentCache? (Hint: think stats.)

9 What is the analyzed value of the name Belkin Mobile Power

Hint: select the name field on the Analysis page

### Step 9) Perform a query:

Navigate in your browser to the following url: 

```text
http://YOURPIPADDRESS:8983/solr/#/techproducts/query
```

If we scroll down and press on *Execute Query*, we will get the following JSON response:

```json
{
  "responseHeader":{
    "zkConnected":true,
    "status":0,
    "QTime":34,
    "params":{
      "q":"*:*",
      "_":"1548912117530"}},
  "response":{"numFound":52,"start":0,"maxScore":1.0,"docs":[
      {
        "id":"0812521390",
        "cat":["book"],
        "name":"The Black Company",
        "price":6.99,
        "price_c":"6.99,USD",
        "inStock":false,
        "author":"Glen Cook",
        "author_s":"Glen Cook",
        "series_t":"The Chronicles of The Black Company",
        "sequence_i":1,
        "genre_s":"fantasy",
        "_version_":1624151760927981568,
        "price_c____l_ns":699}
}}
```

The results will be much longer, but this is snipped for brevity.

### Step 10: Do a query at the command line with curl command

Try the following at your command line:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/select?indent=on&q=*:*"
```

You should get the same JSON output.


### Step 11: Do a single search term

To search for a term, enter it as the q parameter value in the Solr Admin UI Query screen, replacing `*:*` with the term you want to find.

Enter "foundation" and hit Execute Query again.

If you prefer curl, enter something like this:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/select?q=foundation"
```

You’ll see something like this:

```json
{
  "responseHeader":{
    "zkConnected":true,
    "status":0,
    "QTime":8,
    "params":{
      "q":"foundation"}},
  "response":{"numFound":4,"start":0,"maxScore":2.7879646,"docs":[
      {
        "id":"0553293354",
        "cat":["book"],
        "name":"Foundation",
        "price":7.99,
        "price_c":"7.99,USD",
        "inStock":true,
        "author":"Isaac Asimov",
        "author_s":"Isaac Asimov",
        "series_t":"Foundation Novels",
        "sequence_i":1,
        "genre_s":"scifi",
        "_version_":1574100232473411586,
        "price_c____l_ns":799}]
}}
```

The response indicates that there are 4 hits ("numFound":4). We’ve only included one document the above sample output, but since 4 hits is lower than the rows parameter default of 10 to be returned, you should see all 4 of them.



### Step 12:Search for only the id term

Put "id" (without quotes) in the "fl" box and hit Execute Query again. Or, to specify it with curl:


```bash
curl "http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/select?q=foundation&fl=id"
```

You should get the following results.

```json
{
  "responseHeader":{
    "zkConnected":true,
    "status":0,
    "QTime":8,
    "params":{
      "q":"foundation",
      "fl":"id"}},
  "response":{"numFound":4,"start":0,"maxScore":2.7384994,"docs":[
      {
        "id":"0553293354"},
      {
        "id":"UTF8TEST"},
      {
        "id":"SOLR1000"},
      {
        "id":"/home/ubuntu/solr/example/exampledocs/test_utf8.sh"}]
  }}
```

### Step 13: Perform a Field Search

Let us try to search one specific field only: the *category*: `cat`.

Go to the search bar and type `cat:electronics`. Run your query again.

To do this in the command line with curl, you can do the following:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/select?q=cat:electronics"
```

The response:

```json
{
  "responseHeader":{
    "zkConnected":true,
    "status":0,
    "QTime":29,
    "params":{
      "q":"cat:electronics"}},
  "response":{"numFound":12,"start":0,"maxScore":0.9614112,"docs":[
      {
        "id":"SP2514N",
        "name":"Samsung SpinPoint P120 SP2514N - hard drive - 250 GB - ATA-133",
        "manu":"Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.",
        "manu_id_s":"samsung",
        "cat":["electronics",
          "hard drive"],
        "features":["7200RPM, 8MB cache, IDE Ultra ATA-133",
          "NoiseGuard, SilentSeek technology, Fluid Dynamic Bearing (FDB) motor"],
        "price":92.0,
        "price_c":"92.0,USD",
        "popularity":6,
        "inStock":true,
        "manufacturedate_dt":"2006-02-13T15:26:37Z",
        "store":"35.0752,-97.032",
        "_version_":1624151762036326400,
        "price_c____l_ns":9200}
      }
}
```

The result is snipped for brevity. You should get 12 responses.

### Step 14: Do a phrase search

If we want to search for a phrase (as opposed to just multiple individual words) we put it in double quotes.

Try searching for `"CAS Latency"` by putting that in the search box.

To do this with `curl`, the space has to be converted into a `+` sign in the url, like this:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/select?q=\"CAS+latency\""
```

### Step 15: Combine Multiple Searches

When you search for multiple terms, Solr will return results with any of the terms, though those with more than one will be scored higher.

You can combine the results of multiple searches by prefixing each term with a `+` sign.  To exclude the result of a term, you can prefix it with
a `-` sign.

Find the results of `"+electronics +music"`.  You will now get those that must contain **both** terms. You should get one result. 

With `curl`, we have to encode the `+` sign as a `%2B` since the `+` sign will be interpreted as a space.

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/select?q=%2Belectronics+%2Bmusic"
```

To get results that contain `electronics` but **NOT** `music`, then you would enter the term like this: `"+electronics -music"` or with curl as follows:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8983/solr/techproducts/select?q=%2Belectronics+-music"
```

Either way, you should get only a single result.
