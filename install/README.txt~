Solr install (20 min)

In this lab we will practice the installation of the Solr server.


Lab Goals:

1. Install Solr and verify its operation
2. Prepare to use this install for all subsequent labs

== STEP 0) The instructor will provide a CentOS server with SSH access. If you feel more comfortable in Windows environment,
ask the instructor for a Windows server, with a Remote Desktop access. Linux in preferred though, because it comes with the labs.

== STEP 1) Verify that you have Java installed.


== STEP 2) Run the same query in Bing. Measure precision and recall.


== STEP 3) Put the results in a comparison table:

-------------------------------
Query    |  Google  |   Bing  |           
Precision|          |         |
Recall   |          |         |
-------------------------------    


== STEP 4) Challenge: find cases where Bing outperforms Google.
