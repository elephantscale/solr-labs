# Solr indexing and searching, part A. Example documents 

In this lab we will practice the direct indexing of documents with Solr server and searching in them.

### Lab Goals:


1. Index example documents
2. Search the results

### STEP 1) Clean up the index (brute force, we will learn a more sophisticated way at the end of this lab)

After stopping Solr, you can remove all documents by deleting the contents of the data/ directory for your core, such as solr/collection1/data/*. 
When you restart Solr, you will ll have a fresh index with 0 documents.

### STEP 2) Index documents

    cd $SOLR_INSTALL/example/exampledocs
    java -jar post.jar *.xml


### STEP 3) Execute the *:* query. For that, select 'collection1'. Follow the screenshot on the slides.

### STEP 4) Investigate various search options provided by Solr. Compose your list, then compare it to the screenshot on the slides.


# Solr indexing and searching, part B. Tweets in XML and JSON

In this lab we will practice the indexing of XML and JSON tweet documents.

#### The documents are found in this labs's data folder, $SOLR_LAB

For example, $SOLR_LAB=~/solr


Lab Goals:

1. Index tweet documents
2. Search the results

### STEP 1) Index XML documents

    java -jar post.jar $SOLR_LABS/indexing/data/tweets/tweets.xml

### STEP 2) Execute the *:* query. 

Click Query under collection1 in the menu on the left, and execute query type_s:post

### STEP 3) Index JSON documents

    java -Dtype=application/json -jar post.jar $SOLR_LABS/indexing/data/tweets/tweets.json

### Notice:

We use dynamic fields. For instance, screen_name_s will is a string because of the _s suffix on the name.

Question: do we have 4 documents in the index now? We indexed 2 documents 2 times! If not, explain why not.


## Solr indexing and searching, part C: document deletion

In this lab we will practice various ways of deleting documents from the Solr index.


Lab Goals:

1. Delete specific document by ID
2. Delete all documents

### STEP 1) Index documents as above. Use either example documents or tweets.

### STEP 2) To delete a document by ID

Use the following query form

    <delete>
      <id>1</id>
    </delete>

With the update handler below 

    curl http://localhost:8983/solr/update
    
[Hint](https://wiki.apache.org/solr/UpdateXmlMessages)

Another way to delete a document

    java -Ddata=args -Dcommit=? -jar post.jar "<delete><id>?</id></delete>"

### STEP 3) To delete all documents

    curl http://localhost:8983/solr/update --data '<delete><query>*:*</query></delete>' -H 'Content-type:text/xml; charset=utf-8'
    curl http://localhost:8983/solr/update --data '<commit/>' -H 'Content-type:text/xml; charset=utf-8'
