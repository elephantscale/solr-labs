# Inverted index, what is that?

In this lab we will build both regular and inverted index

Lab Goals:

* Understand the concept of index
* Understand inverted index


### STEP 1) Building the beginning of a (regular) index: 

Choose any book of your liking in the "docs" directory
Using any tool (Notepad, VI or NANO editor), prepare the index for the
chosen document, in the form of 

Word -- Lines where this word is found

What questions can you answer using an index?

### STEP 2) Building an inverted index

* Choose a word
* Find this word in all the documents
* Enter an inverted index line in the form

Word -- Documents where the word is found

How would you automate this process?
What questions can you answer using the inverted index?

### STEP 3) Bonus question

Would there be any use to store in the inverted index both the 
document name and the line where the word is found?
