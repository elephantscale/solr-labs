# Precision and Recall

In this lab we will practice measuring the performance of search engines, treating them is IR (information retrieval) systems.
We will look at the two major metrics: precision and recall.


Lab Goals:

1. Run search engine queries, with the view of measuring their metrics.
2. Calculate the precision and recall for Google and Bing.
3. Challenge task



### You will be putting the results in this comparison table:

    | Query    |  Google  |   Bing  |
    | ---------|----------|----------
    | Precision|          |         |
    | Recall   |          |         |

### STEP 1) Run the query of your choice in Google. Measure precision and recall

Assume that the first page returned contains all the results. This assumption is not far from truth, because most people only look at the first page.


### STEP 2) Run the same query in Bing. Measure precision and recall.


### STEP 3) Challenge: find cases where Bing outperforms Google

1. On precision
2. On recall
